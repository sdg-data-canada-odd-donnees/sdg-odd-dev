## How do I suggest improvements to the data hub?

If you have feedback on the data hub, please <a href="mailto:statcan.sdg-odd.statcan@statcan.gc.ca">email us</a>.


## How often will new data be added to this site?

New data will be added as soon as it has been sourced and validated. This includes new data as well as updates to data already published. We will continue to incorporate data from existing sources whenever possible.


## What is the relation between the Global Indicators and the Canadian Indicator Framework?

The Global Indicators are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. These indicators measure progress globally towards 169 targets covering various aspects of society. On the other hand, the Canadian Indicator Framework was developed to measure progress on a series of Canadian priorities related to sustainable development.


## What is the relation between the Global Indicator Framework and Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy?

Canada's 2030 Agenda National Strategy aligns with the United Nations' Global Indicator Framework to monitor and advance the implementation of sustainable development goals. While the Global Indicator Framework offers 231 universal indicators for assessing progress on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Canada's National Strategy customizes these indicators to better fit the national context.

<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/agenda-2030/moving-forward.html">Moving forward together: Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy</a> sets out an approach to accelerate progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Canada, and contribute to their achievement internationally. To promote engagement and action, the following five core objectives have been identified:

1.	Fostering leadership, governance and policy coherence
2.	Raising awareness, engagement and partnerships
3.	Accountability, transparency, measurement and reporting
4.	Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda
5.	Investing in the SDGs 

Through the Global Indicator Frame and the Data Hub, Canada provides the measurement and reporting necessary to ensure accountability and transparency crucial to monitor progress towards the achievement of the 17 Goals and associated global indicators.
