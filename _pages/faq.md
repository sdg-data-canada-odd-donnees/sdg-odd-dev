## How do I suggest improvements to the data hub?

If you have feedback on the data hub, please <a href="mailto:statcan.sdg-odd.statcan@statcan.gc.ca">email us</a>.


## How often will new data be added to this site?

New data will be added as soon as it has been sourced and validated. This includes new data as well as updates to data already published. We will continue to incorporate data from existing sources whenever possible.


## What does the reporting status mean?

We currently use four types of reporting status:

* **Reported online:** Data or information are available to report on this indicator. However, data may not be available for all requested disaggregation at this time.
* **Exploring data sources:** Statistics Canada has not yet found any suitable data sources to report on this indicator. Please [contact us](mailto:statcan.sdg-odd.statcan@statcan.gc.ca) if you have any suggestions.
* **Not available:** No data is available to report on this indicator.
* **Not applicable:** This indicator is not applicable within the Canadian context.


## Why are some indicators classified as proxies?

An indicator is classified as a proxy when it contains some alternative data or methodology to those specified by the United Nations (UN). The indicator presented is the most suitable match currently available. Detailed information regarding the differences between a proxy indicator and its corresponding United Nations indicator can be found in the respective indicator's page.


## What types of data disaggregation are available?

Statistics Canada strives to provide a comprehensive picture of progress by leveraging disaggregated data, where available. As such, data sources are evaluated and selected based on their suitability to report on each indicator and their potential to provide a granular level reporting.

For example, socioeconomic indicators are typically disaggregated by geography and sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, and other population characteristics where available. If data permit and it is relevant for the reporting, indicators are also disaggregated by characteristics such as household characteristics, Indigenous identity, immigrant status and racialized groups, to name a few.

On the other hand, environmental and economic indicators are typically disaggregated by geography, type of economic activity, business characteristics or industry, for example.


## What is the tier classification for the global indicators and what does each of the tiers mean?

To facilitate the implementation of the Global Indicator Framework, all indicators are classified into three tiers based on their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level.

Each SDG indicators are assigned to one (or more) of the following tiers:

* **Tier I:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.
* **Tier II:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.
* **Tier III:** No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

For more information, please consult the [IAEG-SDG Tier Classification for Global Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/).


## How accessible is this website?

Our aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. The <a href="https://open-sdg.org/">Open SDG platform</a> has recently achieved the AA level standard of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).


## What browsers can I use to view this website?

Our website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers (such as IE8) and the Open SDG team is working to fix these.


## Can other countries copy this website?

Yes. This site is built using the <a href="https://open-sdg.org/">Open SDG platform</a>, which is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). See the <a href="https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/">Open SDG Quick Start guide</a> for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running. Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/).
