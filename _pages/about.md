## 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for improving outcomes in the economy, society and the environment. 

At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a universal call to action to:

* end poverty,
* protect the planet,
* and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

The goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow Canada and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental and economic issues, including but not limited to poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind.” Countries are also encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that can include country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieving the SDGs.

## Statistics Canada's Role in The SDGs
Statistics Canada is a trusted producer of high-quality, robust, impartial statistical information to support SDGs. Working in partnership with government departments, the private sector, NGOs and international organizations, we have been actively engaged internationally and domestically to support the measurement of SDGs.

In this role, Statistics Canada is responsible for the following:

* Measuring, reporting, and disseminating Canada’s progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals;
* Maintaining and improving the Global Indicator Framework and <a href="https://sdgcif-data-canada-oddcic-donnee.github.io/">Canadian Indicator Framework data hubs</a>;
* Exploring new ways to work with traditional and non-traditional partners, to examine new sources of data, and to develop new and innovative ways to meet data users' needs through the provision of tools and guidance related to the development of high-quality information;
* Building and strengthening partnerships with governmental colleagues, NGOs, civil-society groups, and the private sector, and international organizations to identify and address data gaps.

## About This Data Hub
Statistics Canada is the central focal point for reporting the data and statistics for both the Canadian and the Global SDG indicators. As such, Statistics Canada developed this interactive data hub using the <a href="https://open-sdg.org/">Open SDG platform</a> to disseminate Canada’s progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Statistics Canada continues to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the indicators and will continue to add further data disaggregation, statistics, and data visualization features to enhance the experience of users over time.

<em>Statistics Canada’s SDG team would like to thank everyone that participated in the quality assurance, made suggestions for improvement or contributed in any other way to the creation of this hub.</em>
