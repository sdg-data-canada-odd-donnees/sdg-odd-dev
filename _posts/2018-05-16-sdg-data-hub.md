The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted on September 25, 2015, by the United Nations General Assembly. The 17 SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They cover a broad range of social and economic development issues, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment that "no one will be left behind." In order to measure and monitor progress on the SDGs, high quality data and information are required. To do this, the government of Canada is launching the SDG data hub, hosted by Statistics Canada.

The <a href="https://www144.statcan.gc.ca/sdg-odd/index-eng.htm">Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub</a> was announced in the 2018 federal budget. Statistics Canada continues to work with other government departments, Canadians and the private sector to expand coverage and access to data from numerous sources, including international organizations, and to lead the work to develop robust measures in Canada for the Global Indicator Framework for Sustainable Development.
